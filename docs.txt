BUGS:
- Reddit thread table doesn't format correctly if there is a separator (|) in the title.
- Challonge participant cuts of part of the name if it contains an ampersand (&).

OPTIMIZING:
- *continue needs to be completely rewritten
- add *getMethods (almost done)
- Add error message when bot is missing Discord permissions
- Implement cooldown for certain roles
